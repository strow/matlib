% function prof = driver_sarta_cloud_rtp_onecldtest(h,ha,p,pa,run_sarta,waterORice)
% takes an input [h ha p pa] which incudes cloud structure from (ERA/ECMWF) and
% then runs the SARTA code. BUT it also dumps out selected profiles, saving only those which are WATER or ICE CLD only
% depending on setting of waterORice
%
% run_sarta = optional structure argument that says
%   >>> options for SARTA runs
%     run_sarta.clear = +/-1 for yes/no, results into prof.clearcalc
%     run_sarta.cloud = +/-1 for yes/no, results into prof.rcalc
%     run_sarta.cumsum = 0 -- 1 to set cloud pressure based on cumulative sum, -ve for just go with "ecmwf2sarta" results
%     run_sarta.klayers_code = string to klayers
%     run_sarta.sartaclear_code = string to sarta clear executable
%     run_sarta.sartacloud_code = string to sarta cloud executable
%     run_sarta.ice_water_separator = set all ciwc/clwc to ice above this, water below this 
%        (default = -1, use ciwc/clwc structures as is)
%     run_sarta.randomCpsize        = +1 or 0 to turn on/off randomizing of ice and water deff
%                                      if 0, then water is ALWAYS 20 um (as in PCRTM wrapper)
%     run_sarta.co2ppm          = -1 to use 370 + (yy-2002)*2.2) in pcrtm/sarta
%                               = +x to use user input value     in pcrtm/sarta 
%                               =  0 to use DEFAULT klayers = 385 (set in executable by Scott; equivalent to run_sarta.co2ppm = +385)
%                   this is done to keep it consistent with PCRTM
%                   however, also have to make sure this is only enabled if h.glist does NOT include gas_2
%      run_sarta.ForceNewSlabs  = -1 (default) to keep any slab clouds that are input, as they are
%                               = +1           to force new slabs to be derived from clwc,ciwc,cc
%      run_sarta.waterORice     = +1/-1        to do water/ice clouds
%
% Requirements : 
%   p must contain ciwc clwc cc from ERA/ECMWF (ie 91xN or 37xN) as well as gas_1 gas_3 ptemp etc
%   this code puts in its own particles sizes, cloud fracs and cloud tops based on ciwc,clwc,cc
%   h.ptype = 0 (ie must be levels profile)
%
% Can do ECM (91 levels) or ERA (37 levels)
%
% testing : 
%   test_onecld_sarta
% though remember, 
%    simplest way of turning off ice   is set p.ciwc = 0
%    simplest way of turning off water is set p.clwc = 0, 
% and then set p.cc = 1
%       if run_sarta.waterORice = +/-1 in PCRTM we set run_sarta.ncol0 == -1, p.cc = 1 and turn off water or ice clouds
%          while in SARTA it turns off appropriate ice or water slab
%          this is test of ONE SLAB CLOUD vs ONE COLUMN CLOUD
